God is good
Live free
do no harm
but take no shit
chase the vision
love your family
local control engenders honesty
be passionate about your disciplines
if there's a fork in the road, take it now
```

```
We are all sinners, never forget that.
We are all in need of humility and grace.
```

```
Do not rest on your laurels, or on anyone else's for that matter.

Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.
