God is good
do no harm
but take no shit
chase the vision
love your family
live free or die a coward
local control engenders honesty
be passionate about your disciplines
if there's a fork in the road, take it now
```

Families perpetuate their own myths,
     cycled through time and an unwavering length of infants;
follow the same road, child,
     and don't hesitate to swear
     to God, country, family.

Countries perpetuate their own logic,
     projected in color TVs and neon lights;
perfidy is unpatriotic, child,
     don't ever lose the faith
     in God, country, family.

God perpetuates sophistry,
     obfuscating virgins and listening to hymns;
ascend ever to the Father, child,
     and don't stop to think
     against God, country, family.
```
```
We are all sinners, never forget that.
We are all in need of humility and grace.

```
There is no greater oppressor than the enemy of Truth; 
  those intent on suppression of Truth are tyrants.

```
Whose idea was it, America?
Who would dare to think of it?

```
Do not rest on your laurels, or on anyone else's for that matter.
```
```
He thrusts me into the belly of the Dragon, 
to struggle, 
to overcome, 
and to stand triumphant in His glory.
