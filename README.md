God is good
do no harm
but take no shit
Live free or die
chase the vision
love your family
local control engenders honesty
be passionate about your disciplines
if there's a fork in the road, take it now
```

```
We are all sinners, never forget that.
We are all in need of humility and grace.
```

```
Do not rest on your laurels,
or on anyone else's for that matter.
```
